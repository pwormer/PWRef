Great problems because of instructions that were not for
Windows (for Mac?). It says "Navigate to change button", but no change
button in sight. And when you hit the wrong button your are left drowning. 
Unfriendly software, they would better say what they are doing (what directories 
and files they pollute your directories with and in what way they
modify the register). Users of GitHub can handle that. I had to
clean up my system thoroughly and download again and again before I
got my files here. And now, how do I get rid of "xxxxxxxx"?

<b>Answer to the last question:</b> "xxxxxxxx" is a commit remark. Make some
changes at the client side (for instance rename), add a more meaningful comment, commit
and sync (at the client). The more meaningful comment will replace "xxxxxxxx".
