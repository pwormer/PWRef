PWRef
=====

A web application for storing and retrieving scientific references.

Comment at the first attempt to make a repository of the files of PWRef 
existing on my disk at home:
Great problems because of stupid instructions which were not for
Windows (for Mac?). It says "Navigate to change button", but no change
button in sight. And when you hit the wrong button your are left on
your own drowning. Shitty software, they would better say what they
are doing (what directories and files they make and in what way they
screw up the register). Users of GitHub can handle that. I had to
clean up my system thoroughly and download again and again before I
got my files here. And now, how do I get rid of "xxxxxxxx"?

Answer to the last question: "xxxxxxxx" is a commit remark. Make some
changes (for instance rename), add a more meaningful comment, commit
and sync. The more meaningful comment will replace "xxxxxxxx".
