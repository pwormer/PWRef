PWRef
=====

First repository of PWRef. Great problems because of stupid
instructions which were not for Windows (for Mac?). It says "Navigate
to change button", but no change button in sight. And when you hit the wrong
button your are left on your own drowning. Shitty software, they would
better say what they are doing (what directories and files they make
and in what way they screw up the register). Users of GitHub can
handle that. I had to clean up my system thoroughly and download again
and again before I got my files here. And now, how do I get rid of
"xxxxxxxx"?
