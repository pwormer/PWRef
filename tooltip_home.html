<b>Input</b> of PWRef is in HTML/UTF-8. Example of input:
<pre style = "margin: 5px 20px 5px 30px;">The absorption by CO&lt;sub>&lt;small>2&lt;/small>&lt;/sub>.</pre>
This is rendered in pretty format on the screen as:
<div style = "text-align: center;">
  The absorption by CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>.
</div>
The only allowed HTML tags are on input:
<pre style = "margin: 5px 10px 0px 10px;">
&lt;b>, &lt;em>, &lt;i>, &lt;sub>, &lt;sup>, &lt;small>, &lt;strong>
</pre>
Special characters may be entered (1) as numeric (hex or dec) HTML entity,
(2) by cut and paste from a UTF-8 character map, or (3)
as HTML mnemonic entity (if it exists). For instance, the Greek capital letter Pi
may be entered as:
<pre style = "margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 10px;">
&amp;#928;(dec), Î (character map), or &amp;Pi;(mnemonic).</pre>

<b>Output</b> can be chosen to be in either of five forms:
Pretty, as HTML, as input for Initialize_db.php, suitable for copy-paste to PWRef, or as BibTeX.
<br><br>
For security reasons, this
program&mdash;as any web application&mdash;is <em>not</em> allowed to
write on a disk of the user. This means that the output must be copy-pasted from the screen
into a user file.

An <b>Internet Explorer-10/11 option</b> is: <em>Check for newer
versions of stored pages</em>. Its default value is: <em>Automatically</em>.

I visit the webpage</em>. <br> To set the option, go to:
    Gear Icon/Internet Options/Tab General/Browsing history/Button Settings.
You arrive at the dialog "Website Data Setting". Click the uppermost radiobutton.
