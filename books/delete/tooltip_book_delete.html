First a list is built of references that may be deleted. The list is constructed according to
the input search parameters on this page.  As a second step the actual references that are to be deleted
must be checkmarked.
<ul>
    <li>All input fields are optional. The default time interval is from last year to the present year.
    <li>All input fields (except the years) may contain a substring of the property searched for.
    <li>If the default time interval is the only input, all book-type publications of this
        and last year will be returned.
    <li>Because on input the the default year is 1 CE, publications with that year may be
        present in the database and should be interpreted as "undated".
    <li>The specified author may be any of the coauthors of the work searched for, he/she is not necessarily
        the first author.
    <li>The specified first and/or last name may be of a (co)editor of  proceedings, books, or similar publications.
    <li>The title field refers to a primary title (title of book or contribution etc.) and may be a substring.
    <li>The key field is required in BibTex and gives a unique identification  of the work.
    <li>The type of work (book, PhD thesis, etc.) may be "All types", in which case <em>all</em>
        book-type publications are searched for.
</ul>
