<ul>
    <li>All input fields are optional. The default time interval is from last year to the present year.
    <li>The specified first and/or last name may be of a (co)author or a  (co)editor of the book-type publication.
    <li>The specified author/editor may be any of the coauthors/coeditors of the work searched for, he/she is not necessarily
        the first author/editor.
    <li>The title field refers to the primary title (title of book or title of a contribution in proceedings, etc.).
    <li>All input fields (except the years) may contain a substring of the property searched for.
    <li>A substring entered in an author's/editor's  name field  must start the name.
        A substring entered in the title field may be anywhere in the title.
    <li>Entering characters in the author's/editor's last name field pops up a suggestion box that contains  names present in the database.
        The more characters are entered the shorter the list of suggested names becomes.
    <li>If the default time interval is the only input, all book-type publications of this
        and last year will be returned.
    <li>Because in the input to PWRef the default year is 1 CE (AD), publications with that year may be
        present in the database.  They must be interpreted as "undated".
    <li>The key field is required in BibTex and gives a unique identification  of the work.
    <li>The type of work (book, PhD thesis, etc.) may be "All types", in which case <em>all</em>
        book-type publications are searched for.
