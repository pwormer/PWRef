    <li>To add an extra author input line: Hit the active enter key in
        one of the two lowest author fields (either in first or last name field),

    <li>To remove the last author line, blank out both first- and last name and hit
        the active enter key.</li>
    <li>An inactive enter key can neither add nor remove an author input line.</li>
    <li>To deactivate the enter key: Hit the key in the lowest <em>empty</em> author

        this action removes the empty line.</li>

        on the review page. The present input page is shown again with an active enter key. </li>
